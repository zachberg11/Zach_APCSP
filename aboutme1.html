    <p class="p">Hello, my name is Zachary Berg and I was born in Berkeley, California. I am currently a junior at Piedmont High School and soon will be a senior. I have many different interests in a lot of things. That would include; photography, physics, astrophysics, astronomy and tennis. I also love the outdoors and the many wonders it has to offer including, hiking, camping, climbing, exploring and observing nature. I started to look at several colleges but still don't know where I am going to go or what I'm going to major in. I hope you have a good time browsing through my website.</p>
