<h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p class="p">This page will show some projects that I worked on. I will have photos that I took and spent a while getting the right shot. Other projects that my or may note be on here would be ones that I either worked on for a school assignment or at home for fun. </p>

<p class="p">The photo above is one that I took during a trip to Yellowstone with a group over the summer. I took hundreds and hundreds of photos during the trip and the one above is my favorite. I was able to capture this picture inside the van somehow and once we got back to the place we were staying, I spent around an hour perfecting every tiny detail of it to make sure it turns out the way I want it to.</p>

<p class="p">This picture above was taken more recently and it was during the lunar eclpse of 2022. It wasn't the best night because it was cloudy in our area but I got lucky enough because for a split second the clouds moved away from the moon and I captured what I wanted. Not too long after, I edited and enhanced the photo to make it more clear and visible. </p>

<p class="p">This was a project that I worked on several years ago with a friend through Camp Galileo. The certain class I was taking was on computers and programing. We decided to work together and I came up with the idea to build Perry the Platypus. This project took us the whole week and the final product was well worth all of our time and effort. </p>
